**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Final Status:** ✅ 100% COMPLETE

---

## 📊 Overview

### Initial Problem ❌
- Dashboard showing `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`
- Users couldn't access `/dashboard`
- Login flow completely broken
- Infinite redirect loop (30+ redirects)

### Final Result ✅
- ✅ Dashboard accessible
- ✅ Single redirect to login (when not authenticated)
- ✅ No ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error
- ✅ All build checks passing
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ Consistent protection pattern across all pages

## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fix #1: Dashboard Redirect Loop (PRIMARY)
**File:** `app/dashboard/layout.client.tsx`
- **Issue:** `useState` caused re-renders → infinite redirects
- **Solution:** Changed to `useRef` to prevent re-renders
- **Result:** Single redirect instead of 30+
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Fix #2: Portal Page Protection (PREVENTIVE)
**File:** `app/portal/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** Potential redirect loop on unprotected page
- **Solution:** Added `useRef` guard for redirect
- **Result:** Consistent protection pattern
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Fix #3: Reports Page Protection (PREVENTIVE)
**File:** `app/reports/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** Potential redirect loop on unprotected page
- **Solution:** Added `useRef` guard for redirect
- **Result:** Consistent protection pattern
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
