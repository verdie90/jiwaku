## Known Issues & Limitations

### Currently No Issues Found ✅

**Design Limitations (Accepted Trade-offs)**
1. Trigger delays not yet implemented (framework ready)
2. Logical operators (AND/OR) typed but not evaluated
3. Webhook triggers planned for Part 5
4. Rule versioning not implemented
5. Execution history limited to recent entries

## Upcoming Work

### Phase 3C Part 5: Webhooks (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated**: 900+ LOC
- Webhook management service
- Event trigger system
- Testing UI
- Integration with automation rules

### Phase 3C Part 6: Analytics (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated**: 1,000+ LOC
- Metrics calculation engine
- Dashboard with charts
- Report generation
- Export functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Reporting
**Estimated**: 1,200+ LOC
- SLA analytics
- Team performance metrics
- Customer satisfaction tracking
- Predictive insights

## Migration Path

**From Phase 3C.4 to 3C.5**
1. Reuse automation service architecture
2. Extend trigger system for webhooks
3. Add webhook validation
4. Integrate with existing rules

**From Phase 3C to Phase 4**
1. Leverage existing analytics hook patterns
2. Build on ticket service queries
3. Extend filtering for complex reports
4. Add new chart components

## Team Recommendations

### For Development

- Recommend testing with sample use cases
- Demo rules provide good reference implementations
- All endpoints properly documented

### For Operations
- Monitor rule executions via logs
- Set up alerts for high error rates
- Backup automation rules regularly
- Review rule performance quarterly

### For Product
- Gather user feedback on rule templates
- Plan advanced trigger types for roadmap
- Consider custom field validation UI
- Plan webhook integration timeline
