- ✅ **package.json scripts** - Convenient npm commands for seeding
- ✅ **Updated dashboard** - Displays real Firestore data with mock fallback

---

## 🚀 Quick Implementation (5 Minutes)

### Phase 1: Prepare Firebase (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Download service account key
# - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
# - Select your project
# - ⚙️ Settings → Service Accounts → Generate New Private Key
# - Save to: ./firebaseKey.json

# 2. Set environment variable (Windows PowerShell)
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\full\path\to\firebaseKey.json"

# On macOS/Linux, use:
# export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/full/path/to/firebaseKey.json"

# 3. Verify it's set
Write-Output $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
# Should show the path
```

### Phase 2: Seed Data (1 minute)

```bash
# Option A: Using npm script (easiest)
npm run seed

# Option B: Using node directly
node scripts/seed-firestore.js

# Wait for output:
# ✨ All demo data has been seeded to Firestore!
```

### Phase 3: Verify (2 minutes)

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to
# http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tickets

# You should see 8 tickets displayed!
```

---

## 🔧 Installation & Configuration

### Step 1: Install Firebase Admin SDK

The SDK is already in package.json. Verify it's installed:

```bash
npm list firebase-admin
# Should show: firebase-admin@12.0.0+
```

If not installed:
```bash
npm install firebase-admin
```

### Step 2: Get Service Account Key

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click ⚙️ **Settings** (gear icon, top left)
4. Go to **Service Accounts** tab
5. Click **Generate New Private Key**
6. A JSON file downloads automatically
7. Save it securely (e.g., `firebaseKey.json` in project root)

**IMPORTANT:** Keep this file private! Add to `.gitignore`:
```bash
echo "firebaseKey.json" >> .gitignore
echo "firebase-admin-key.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variable

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Set for current session
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\path\to\firebaseKey.json"

# Verify
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# For permanent setup (all sessions), use:
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS", "C:\path\to\firebaseKey.json", "User")
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\path\to\firebaseKey.json

REM For permanent setup (all sessions)
setx GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS C:\path\to\firebaseKey.json
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Set for current session
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/firebaseKey.json"

# For permanent setup, add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
echo 'export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/firebaseKey.json"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 4: Verify Firestore Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules allow writes. Development rules:

```javascript
// DEVELOPMENT ONLY - Allow all reads/writes
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

To update in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Click **Rules** tab
3. Paste the above rules
4. Click **Publish**

**⚠️ WARNING:** Use proper security rules in production! See FIRESTORE_SETUP_GUIDE.md for production rules.

## ▶️ Running the Seed Script

### Using npm Script (Recommended)

```bash
npm run seed
```

**Why use npm script?**
- No need to remember the file path
- Automatically uses correct Node.js version
- Works across all operating systems
- Listed in package.json for team visibility

### Using Node Directly

```bash
node scripts/seed-firestore.js
```

### Using Reset Script

Delete all data and reseed:

```bash
npm run seed:reset
```

This command:
1. Deletes the entire `teams` collection from Firestore
2. Waits for completion
3. Runs the seed script to repopulate with fresh data

### Expected Output

✨ All demo data has been seeded to Firestore!

Next steps:
1. Start development server: npm run dev
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tickets
3. You should see 8 demo tickets with various statuses
4. Create new tickets, update statuses, add comments, and test all features
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Firestore Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Firestore Database** in left menu
4. Click **Data** tab
5. Expand `teams` → `team-1`
6. You should see:
   - `contacts` subcollection (5 docs)
   - `tickets` subcollection (8 docs)
   - `users` subcollection (6 docs)

### Step 2: Test Dashboard Display

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tickets
# or navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tickets
```

You should see:
- **Left panel:** List of 8 tickets with status badges
- **Middle panel:** Details of selected ticket
- **Right panel:** Form to create new ticket
- All tickets properly colored by priority

### Step 3: Test Basic CRUD

1. **Read:** Click on different tickets, verify details load
2. **Create:** Fill the form and create a new ticket
3. **Update:** Click "Update" after changing a ticket's status
4. **Delete:** Delete a ticket (should remove from both app and Firestore)

### Step 4: Real-Time Sync Test

1. Keep dashboard open
2. Open Firestore Console in another tab
3. Create a ticket in the dashboard
4. Check Firestore Console - new document should appear within 2 seconds
5. Update a ticket in dashboard
6. Check Firestore Console - document should update immediately

## 🎨 Dashboard Integration

The dashboard has been updated to:

1. **Try Firestore first**
   ```typescript
   const { data: tickets = [] } = useTickets(teamId);
   ```

2. **Show loading state**
   ```typescript
   if (isLoading && tickets.length === 0) {
     return <div>Loading tickets from Firestore...</div>;
   }
   ```

3. **Fall back to mock data if needed**
   ```typescript
   const displayTickets = tickets.length > 0 ? tickets : MOCK_TICKETS;
   ```

4. **Handle errors gracefully**
   ```typescript
   if (error && tickets.length === 0) {
     return <div>Error: {error.message} (Using mock data)</div>;
   }
   ```

This means:
- ✅ Production database works seamlessly
- ✅ Falls back to demo data if Firestore unavailable
- ✅ Developers can test without Firebase setup
- ✅ Zero downtime migrations

## 🔄 Customizing Demo Data

To modify the demo data:

1. Open `scripts/seed-firestore.js`
2. Find the `DEMO_DATA` object
3. Modify any contact, ticket, or user data
4. Save and run: `npm run seed:reset`

Example: Change ticket priority

```javascript
// Before
title: 'Login page not loading',
priority: 'high',

// After
title: 'Login page not loading',
priority: 'urgent',  // Changed from high to urgent
```

After modifying, reseed:
```bash
npm run seed:reset
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS not set"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\full\path\to\serviceAccountKey.json"

# Verify
Write-Output $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# Then run
npm run seed
```

### Issue 2: "Service account key not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check file exists
ls -la "C:\path\to\file.json"  # Windows
ls -la "/path/to/file.json"    # macOS/Linux

# 2. Use absolute path (not relative)
# ❌ Don't: ./firebaseKey.json
# ✅ Do: C:\Users\username\Documents\firebaseKey.json

# 3. Try with quotes if path has spaces
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\Program Files\firebase key.json"
```

### Issue 3: "Permission denied" from Firestore

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check/update security rules in Firebase Console
// Must allow writes during development:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;  // Add this line
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue 4: "Cannot find module 'firebase-admin'"

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install firebase-admin
# or if that doesn't work
npm install --save firebase-admin
npm install
```

### Issue 5: Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever

**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify `.env.local` has correct Firebase config
4. Check Firestore security rules (must allow reads)
5. Refresh page with Ctrl+Shift+Del (clear cache)

### Issue 6: Data not appearing in Firestore Console

**Solution:**
1. Wait 30 seconds (Console may be slow to refresh)
2. Press F5 to refresh Firestore Console page
3. Check correct Firebase project is selected
4. Verify script completed with "✨" message
5. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
