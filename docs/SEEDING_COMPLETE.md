## 🎨 Dashboard Integration

The dashboard automatically:
1. **Fetches from Firestore** using React Query hooks
2. **Shows loading state** while data is being retrieved
3. **Falls back to mock data** if Firestore unavailable
4. **Handles errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
5. **Updates in real-time** when data changes in Firestore

This means:
- ✅ Production-ready (uses real database)
- ✅ Development-friendly (works offline with mock data)
- ✅ Zero downtime (graceful degradation)
- ✅ Testable (can test without Firebase)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Environment variable not set | Use absolute path: `$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\full\path"` |
| Service account key not found | Verify file exists and use absolute path (not relative) |
| Permission denied | Check Firestore security rules allow writes |
| Module not found | Run `npm install firebase-admin` |
| Dashboard shows Loading | Check .env.local Firebase config, refresh browser |
| Data not in Console | Wait 30s, refresh page, verify correct project selected |
