### Mock Data
The app includes 2 sample contacts:
1. **John Doe** - john@example.com, Tech Corp, Product Manager
2. **Jane Smith** - jane@example.com, Design Studio, Designer

### Database Integration
The service layer is ready for Firebase Firestore:
- Replace mock data with API calls
- All CRUD operations are prepared
- Error handling is in place
- Loading states are ready

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Contact not found" error
- The contact list may not have loaded yet
- Refresh the page or check browser console
- Ensure you're on `/dashboard/contacts` route

### Search not working
- Type characters into the search box
- The search is real-time and case-insensitive
- Try searching by different fields (name, email, phone)

### Form won't submit
- Check that you've filled required fields:
  - First name (required)
  - Last name (required)
  - Email OR Phone (at least one required)
- Look for error messages in the form

### Contacts not saving
- The app uses mock data for now
- Real persistence will work when connected to Firebase
- Check browser console for errors

### Build errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Clear cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
