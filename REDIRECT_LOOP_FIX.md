# 🔧 Fix for ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS on Dashboard

**Issue:** Infinite redirect loop when accessing `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Date Fixed:** October 23, 2025

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error occurred because:

1. **DashboardLayout** was checking authentication state and redirecting to `/login`
2. The redirect logic could be triggered multiple times due to:
   - State updates causing re-renders
   - Multiple redirect calls before the first one completed
   - The redirect condition being re-evaluated during the redirect itself

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed DashboardLayout Redirect Logic**
**File:** `app/dashboard/layout.client.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Multiple state variables (`hasRedirected`, `mounted`) were used
- Redirect could happen during state updates
- Component re-rendered while redirect was happening

**Solution:**
- Used `useRef` instead of `useState` for redirect tracking
- `useRef` persists across renders without triggering re-renders
- Prevents redirect from being called multiple times

```typescript
// Before ❌
const [hasRedirected, setHasRedirected] = React.useState(false);
const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);

// After ✅
const redirectRef = React.useRef(false);
```

**Why this works:**
- `useRef` is persistent and doesn't cause re-renders
- Only checks if `!isLoading && !user && !redirectRef.current`
- Sets `redirectRef.current = true` immediately, preventing re-calls
- No dependency array complications

### 2. **Improved Dashboard Page**
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Page was calling `useAuth()` twice (once on its own, once in DashboardLayout)
- Could cause double auth checks

**Solution:**
- Ensured single `useAuth()` usage
- DashboardLayout handles auth check and redirect
- Page receives user data only if authenticated

## 📊 Before & After

### Before (❌ ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS)
```
Browser:  Visit /dashboard
         ↓
App:      DashboardLayout checks auth
         ↓
State:    isLoading=false, user=null, hasRedirected=false
         ↓
Effect:   Sets hasRedirected=true, calls router.push("/login")
         ↓
Render:   Component re-renders
         ↓
Effect:   Runs again due to state/dependency changes
         ↓
Result:   Multiple redirects → ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS ❌
```

### After (✅ Single Redirect)
```
Browser:  Visit /dashboard
         ↓
App:      DashboardLayout checks auth
         ↓
State:    isLoading=false, user=null
         ↓
Effect:   Checks redirectRef.current (false)
         ↓
Action:   Sets redirectRef.current=true, calls router.push("/login") once
         ↓
Result:   Single redirect to login, no re-trigger ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Redirect When Not Logged In
```bash
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Clear all localStorage
3. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
4. Expected: Single redirect to /login (check Network tab for 1 redirect)
```

### Test 2: Access Dashboard When Logged In
```bash
1. Login at http://localhost:3000/login
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. Expected: Dashboard loads without redirects
4. Check browser console for "Loading authentication..." message
```

### Test 3: Browser Back Button
```bash
1. Login and navigate to dashboard
2. Go to another page
3. Click browser back button
4. Expected: Dashboard loads correctly
```

## 🔐 Why This Fix is Safe

### ✅ Prevents Multiple Redirects
- `useRef` is checked before redirect
- Can only redirect once per component mount
- No circular redirect logic

### ✅ Maintains Auth Flow
- Still checks `isLoading` to wait for auth state
- Still checks `user` to verify authentication
- Still redirects if user is not authenticated

### ✅ Clean Code
- Simpler than multiple state variables
- No complex dependency arrays
- Clear intent: prevent multiple redirects

### ✅ Proper Error Handling
- Console log helps with debugging
- Returns `null` while loading
- Returns `null` if not authenticated (before redirect takes effect)

## 🆘 If Issue Persists

If you still see ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   ```bash
   # Clear DevTools cache
   F12 → Application → Clear site data
   ```

2. **Check localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('authToken')    // Should be null if not logged in
   localStorage.getItem('cachedUser')   // Should be null if not logged in
   ```

3. **Check browser logs:**
   ```
   F12 → Console
   Look for "[DashboardLayout] Redirecting to login - no user found"
   ```

4. **Verify login works:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Check if localStorage is populated
   - Try accessing dashboard again
